## What is IOT?

Network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and interact with their internal states or the external environment.

>When one system can connect thousands and devices and data, thats the internet of things. - Steve Pears, Telent

## Historical Perspective
Evolution from mainframes, through pc's, to client server, then cloud, now IoT, cloud and devices coming together.

Technological capacity is increasing rapidly, human capability is not.

From 1985, increases in available storage of 25 million %, memory 1.2 million %, weight reduced by 1000%

We have stuff like 3D printing, bodymetrics, Self Driving cards, Robotics, Quantum computing, cloud platform, and now IOT, connected medical devices


Microsoft Chicago Datacenter - 2 people, door men. How is this possible? Well....IOT.

## Problem statement
How to ingest data?

millions of devices

massive amounts of data

can be processed in near real-time fashion

	real time is context sensitive
	

#### In rush problem
Disconnect and reconnect => suddenly a flood of data will arrive
solve by switching to async from synchronous comms.


### Stuff of interest
MQTT

Esper  / NEsper

RDF Format.

## How does it work?
Made up of

1. Identity
2. Edge node + controller
3.  ???
4.  End user

##Â Usages
Data feeds into a storage place, enables analysis that can allow prediction etc.

This creates a data marketplace...
