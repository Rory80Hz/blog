# µCon 2014: The Microservices Conference
My notes from Day One and Two of the µ-services conference. Mostly my interpretations of the messages the guys were delivering, where possible i'll link to the original source material if available (any objections from the original presenters to this being online I'm happy to remove it)
	
## Day One

What a superb first day that was, plenty of recurring themes, and a huge amount to digest. Picked up some new approaches to problems, and some interesting aspects to apply to problems in future, in terms of thinking.

As with all things, even though the focus was on micro-services, what they are, and what it means, it all needs to be taken in the context of dedication to the craft of building things well. 

Micro-services alone are not a solution to all lifes problems, they are not always the right thing to do, but in certain circumstances, and with the right consideration they can be an incredibly powerful approach, or principle to unlock the ability to build software that delivers real value to users, and to adapt to the universes one true constant, change.

This blog posting will evolve, as I try to tie together the various ideas the presenters provided into a more coherent message, as usual, there are common threads that run through them, just need to weave them together :)
