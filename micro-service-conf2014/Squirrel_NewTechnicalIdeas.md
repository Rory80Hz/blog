# Another Of Your Harebrained Schemes: Why Executives Should (or Shouldn't) Back Microservices

Innovators just try stuff out.

Early Adopters try stuff out to get an improvement, not averse to experimentation.

Early Majority are not interested in unproven experiments, they want known proven safe stuff!

Late Majority, these guys love standards, university told me this is how it should work, so therefore it must be so. They will do stuff once someone like Gartner writes a report for them.

Laggards, they won't change.

It is important to understand where you are on this scale when applying.....

### SPIN - Neil Rackman
Four things to do before trying to sell the solution. Use the right sort of language, something that the stakeholders understand. Once you capture the first three steps, maybe go off and think about things on your own...does the solution solve the problem? 

If NO then maybe don't try to sell the solution....it is not always the case that your idea for a solution is something you can really sell.

This isn't just about Âµ-services, but any solution (or outcome as suggested in Russ' talk).

It can also be applied to an existing solution, which can be helpful when reviewing existing decisions.

#### Situation
What is the general situation, are we a startup, or a long established company who are being disrupted by smaller outfits...etc. etc.

To expand a bit further...

Where is the company on the Technology Adoption Lifecycle.

How many customers do they have?

What is the culture within the company?

#### Problem
What is the specific problem we are dealing with...

Is it maybe customer retention, is someone else stealing their customer base.

Has someone got a better, cheaper, faster way to do things?

Is the system way too difficult to use...

#### Implication
So what is happening because of this? What are we losing out on?

Customers leave en masse, company dies.


#### Need-Payoff
Do the business really care that much? Is it so bad if the thing keeps happening?

What is the thing you get by implementing your solution...do we save time, do we reduce bugs, can we react to change faster?

What is the awesome business benefit from this?

This all sounds great, whats this going to cost though? What are the risks?

How can you help people understand what this will give them?

Think hard about the cost and the approach, is it an all or nothing situation...do we destroy a monolith entirely, or do we pick out problem parts bit by bit...again, relate this back to value.
